Gameplay

    Use the arrow keys to control the snake's direction (Up, Down, Left, Right).
    The snake grows in length as it eats the food represented by "o".
    Avoid hitting the walls or the snakeâ€™s own body.
    The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls.
    Press Enter to exit the game after it ends.

Code Structure

Coordinates: Class used to represent the position of the snake, food, and walls on the grid.

The game runs in an infinite loop where the snake moves, checks for collisions, and updates the screen until the game is over.
